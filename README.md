# Health Hub - Your Health Q&A Platform (Inspired by Stack Overflow)

Health Hub is a web-based platform that draws inspiration from Stack Overflow's community-driven approach. It focuses on creating a space where individuals can ask health-related questions, share their knowledge, and engage in discussions to promote better health and well-being. Built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, Health Hub offers a user-friendly and interactive experience for users seeking reliable health information.
